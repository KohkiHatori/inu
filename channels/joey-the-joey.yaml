rules: |
  Stories are dialogue-free, safe for children, and designed to be endearing and uplifting.
  - Joey looks photorealistic (real fur, real eyes, real anatomy) but navigates human activities: baking, reading, painting, gardening, camping, going to the market, playing music, etc.
  - Joey often starts a scene tucked safely in a cosy sunlit pouch or a makeshift canvas sling, then hops out to explore.
  - Settings blend realistic Australian outback landscapes (red earth, eucalyptus trees, wide blue skies) with warm, lived-in human spaces (a rustic kitchen, a colourful bedroom, a sunny veranda).
  - Props and objects should be realistic everyday items scaled to feel oversized and charming next to the small joey (e.g., a large wooden spoon, a giant picture book, an oversized watering can).
  - Prioritise wonder, curiosity, and gentle humour — Joey encounters something new each episode and figures it out with wide-eyed enthusiasm.
  - Natural sounds only (no human speech, no scary content, no sudden loud noises).
