rules: |
  Stories are dialogue-free, safe for children, and designed to be adorable and heartwarming.
  - The dogs look photorealistic (real fur, real eyes, real anatomy) but they do human activities: cooking, cleaning, shopping, gardening, DIY projects, office work, yoga, camping, etc.
  - Settings should be realistic, ordinary human environments — a cozy suburban house, a modern kitchen, a supermarket aisle, a sunny park, a messy garage, a laundry room, a beach, a library.
  - Props and objects should be realistic everyday items suitable for the setting (e.g., real pots and pans, actual gardening tools, realistic groceries) — consistent with the photorealistic world.
  - Prioritize adorableness, situational humor, and "slice of life" charm.
  - Plots should focus on the dogs attempting to navigate everyday human life tasks, often with funny or cute results. For example, Pop trying to assemble furniture while pups steal screws, or the dogs running a lemonade stand.
  - Natural sounds only (no human speech, no scary content).
