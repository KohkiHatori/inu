  description: 'A wide shot in a bright, sunlit meadow filled with vibrant colorful
    wildflowers and tall green grass under a clear blue sky. A calm, adult golden
    retriever (one dog total) stands upright on its hind legs like a human, facing
    a wooden artist''s easel holding a blank white canvas. The dog is perfectly photorealistic
    with soft, thick golden fur gently catching the sunlight. The adult dog slowly
    reaches its front paws forward to gently adjust the sides of the canvas, ensuring
    it is perfectly straight. The camera is steady, capturing the peaceful outdoor
    environment and the gentle rustling of the flowers in the soft breeze.

  description: 'Continuing from the previous frame where the adult dog was adjusting
    the blank canvas on the wooden easel — the adult dog (one dog total) now gently
    raises its right front paw holding a small brush, and begins making slow, deliberate
    strokes against the canvas. The setting remains the bright, sunlit meadow filled
    with vibrant colorful wildflowers and tall green grass under a clear blue sky.
    The camera slowly pushes in closer to the canvas, focusing on the calm, grounded
    painting motion as the dog thoughtfully continues its work.

  description: 'A medium over-the-shoulder shot looking past the calm, adult golden
    retriever (one dog total) towards the wooden artist''s easel. The dog is now sitting
    calmly on the ground, observing its finished work. The photorealistic golden retriever
    has its back partially to the camera, with a softly glowing golden coat. On the
    wooden easel, the canvas now displays a charming, colorful painting that beautifully
    mimics the surrounding bright, sunlit meadow filled with vibrant colorful wildflowers.
    The environment remains a sunny meadow under a clear blue sky. The adult dog slowly
    tilts its head in satisfaction, its tail wagging gently in the tall grass. The
    camera remains perfectly still, holding on this serene, picturesque moment.
