title: The Cloud Kingdom Donut Delivery
concept: In a whimsical sky kingdom made of glowing clouds and pastel floating islands,
  an adult golden retriever and its two energetic puppies run a magical bakery. They
  bake giant, colorful 3D CG donuts and deliver them via a hot air balloon shaped
  like a giant shiny teapot. During their flight, they use an oversized sparkling
  pinwheel to gently clear a flock of giant origami birds out of their path before
  making a triumphant delivery to a floating crystal castle.
