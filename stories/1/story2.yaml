title: The Great Galaxy Cake Delivery
concept: Inside a magical space bakery with walls made of starry purple icing, a photorealistic
  adult golden retriever and two puppies bake a glowing, celestial cake using giant,
  whimsical 3D cartoon tools. After frosting the cake with a purple blaster and decorating
  it with orbiting candy comets, they load the masterpiece into a shiny orange bubble-canopy
  UFO and fly through a cotton-candy nebula to deliver it to a floating candy-cane
  space station.

    snout, a photorealistic larger fluffy golden puppy with oversized paws, and a
    photorealistic smaller golden puppy with a white chest patch. They are inside
    a whimsical space bakery with walls made of starry purple icing. The adult dog
    is stirring a giant, glowing blue mixing bowl on a pastel pink counter. The larger
    puppy holds a shiny green, oversized cartoon spoon. The smaller puppy holds a
    stylized glass jar filled with floating yellow star sprinkles. In the background,
    there is an unlit retro cartoon rocket-shaped oven and a shiny purple frosting
    blaster resting on the counter. Beside the bowl sits a shiny red star-shaped cake
    pan.
