title: Joey the Gardener
concept: 'Joey spots a drooping sunflower in a sunroom and decides it needs a drink.
  He finds a giant watering can, but it is far too heavy for him to tip with his small
  paws, leading to a frustrating spill on the floor. Determined to help his leafy
  friend, Joey figures out how to use his powerful hind legs and tail for leverage
  to successfully water the plant, beaming with pride when the flower perks up.

  description: 'Vertical framing. One baby kangaroo sits curiously in a bright, rustic
    sunroom with terracotta tiled floors and sunlight streaming through large glass
    windows overlooking a red dirt outback. Beside the baby kangaroo rests one large,
    heavily oversized galvanized steel watering can and one large terracotta pot containing
    a tall, slightly drooping bright yellow sunflower. The baby kangaroo tilts its
    head toward the drooping flower with a gentle, curious expression (one kangaroo
    total).

    curiously next to the pot in the bright sunroom — the baby kangaroo slowly leans
    forward to sniff the drooping petals of the sunflower, then looks down at the
    giant watering can. The rustic sunroom remains bathed in warm sunlight over the
    terracotta tiles (one kangaroo total).

  description: 'Low angle, vertical framing. The baby kangaroo stands upright next
    to the giant galvanized steel watering can on the terracotta floor of the rustic
    sunroom with large glass windows. The baby kangaroo places its small front paws
    against the metal side, pushing gently, but the heavy can does not budge. The
    baby kangaroo wears a slightly frustrated, determined expression with flattened
    ears (one kangaroo total).

    the heavy watering can in the sunroom — the baby kangaroo pushes harder, causing
    its small paws to slip slightly on the terracotta floor. The large watering can
    tilts slightly, spilling a tiny drop of water onto the tiles instead of the flower.
    The sunroom remains bright and warm (one kangaroo total).

    while pushing the watering can — the baby kangaroo sits back solidly onto its
    strong tail, letting go of the can. It looks up at the large metal spout with
    a thoughtful, wide-eyed, and frustrated expression. The terracotta floor of the
    sunroom catches the warm sunlight (one kangaroo total).

  description: 'Side profile shot, vertical framing. In the bright sunroom with terracotta
    tiles, the baby kangaroo hops around to the back handle of the giant galvanized
    watering can, positioning itself perfectly between the can and the terracotta
    pot containing the drooping sunflower. The baby kangaroo firmly plants its strong
    hind legs on the floor and uses its thick tail for balance, its face showing deep
    focus (one kangaroo total).

    itself behind the watering can in the sunroom — the baby kangaroo uses the leverage
    of its powerful hind legs to push its body weight forward. The heavy watering
    can tilts smoothly, and a steady stream of water gently pours from the spout directly
    into the soil of the sunflower pot (one kangaroo total).

  description: 'Close up, vertical framing. The baby kangaroo''s face is positioned
    right next to the bright yellow sunflower in the sunlit rustic sunroom. The sunflower
    now looks perky and vibrant, reaching toward the light. The baby kangaroo''s oversized
    ears are perked up, and it wears a bright, happy, and proud expression, gazing
    warmly at the revitalized flower (one kangaroo total).
