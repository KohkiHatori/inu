title: Joey's Thirsty Little Plant
concept: Joey hops out onto a sunny outback veranda and discovers an oversized red
  watering can. He drags it through the dusty garden, figuring out how to fill it
  from a hose, all to save a drooping little potted seedling that needs a drink.

  description: 'A wide shot on a rustic wooden veranda in the Australian outback,
    bathed in warm morning sunlight. In the background, red earth and tall eucalyptus
    trees meet a wide blue sky. There is one baby kangaroo sitting comfortably beside
    a cozy canvas sling chair. Directly in front of the single baby kangaroo sits
    a giant bright red watering can, which is oversized compared to the tiny animal.
    The kangaroo looks at the red watering can with wide, curious eyes. The lighting
    is soft and natural, creating gentle shadows on the wooden floorboards.

  description: 'Continuing from the previous frame where the single baby kangaroo
    was looking at the oversized watering can on the sunlit veranda — the baby kangaroo
    slowly leans its upper body forward, stretching its neck to gently sniff the large
    perforated spout of the red watering can. The warm outback sunlight continues
    to illuminate the wooden floorboards and the eucalyptus trees in the background.
    The kangaroo''s movements are slow, cautious, and completely grounded.

    was sniffing the spout — the baby kangaroo gently bumps the side of the bright
    red watering can with its soft nose. The empty watering can tips ever so slightly
    on the wooden veranda floor, making a soft wobbling motion. The baby kangaroo''s
    ears twitch with curiosity. The outback garden setting remains sunny and peaceful.

  description: 'A medium tracking shot along a dusty, red-earth garden path lined
    with smooth river stones. The single baby kangaroo is slowly walking forward on
    its hind legs, using its front paws to drag the bright red watering can by its
    curved bottom handle. The oversized watering can slides along the dry red dirt.
    The background features a rustic wooden fence and native Australian shrubs under
    a bright, cloudless blue sky.

    stops moving and drops the handle of the watering can. The baby kangaroo turns
    its head to look down at the ground beside the path, its large ears swiveling
    forward in concern. The red earth, rustic fence, and bright blue sky remain steady
    in the background.

  description: 'A low-angle close-up shot on the dry red dirt path. The single baby
    kangaroo is kneeling down next to a rustic terracotta pot. Inside the pot is a
    small, drooping green leafy seedling surrounded by very dry, cracked potting soil.
    The baby kangaroo leans its face close to the sad potted seedling, looking at
    it with a soft, sympathetic expression. The bright sunlight casts crisp shadows
    across the dusty ground and the textured terracotta pot.

    front paw and gently pats the dry, cracked dirt inside the terracotta pot. After
    touching the dirt, the baby kangaroo turns its head away from the pot, looking
    back toward the garden path with a determined look in its eyes. The lighting remains
    warm and sunny on the red earth.

  description: 'A medium shot near a weathered wooden garden tap post. The single
    baby kangaroo is standing next to the bright red watering can, which is positioned
    directly beneath the tap post. Resting on the ground beside the watering can is
    a coiled green garden hose with a heavy brass nozzle. The outback setting features
    bright sunlight, dusty red earth, and the shadows of eucalyptus leaves swaying
    gently overhead. The baby kangaroo looks down at the brass nozzle.

    hose. The kangaroo pushes the nozzle upward until it hooks over the top rim of

    of water begins to flow from the brass nozzle, splashing softly into the bottom
    of the bright red watering can. The single baby kangaroo watches the water fall
    with wide, fascinated eyes, keeping its paws securely on the hose. The warm sunlight
    sparkles on the flowing water.

    baby kangaroo is now carefully pushing the bright red watering can, which appears
    much heavier now, toward the rustic terracotta pot containing the drooping green
    seedling. The kangaroo uses its chest and front paws to slide the watering can
    across the dirt. The outback environment is vibrant, with the blue sky and green

    the terracotta pot. The green seedling is now glistening with water drops and
    stands noticeably taller and perkier in the dark, wet soil. The baby kangaroo
    sits calmly, resting its front paws in its lap, looking at the revived potted
    seedling with a soft, bright-eyed expression of joy. The outback sunlight glows
    warmly on the kangaroo''s caramel fur and the vibrant green leaves of the plant.

    was sitting happily beside the perky seedling — the single baby kangaroo does
    a very small, gentle, and joyful hop in place beside the terracotta pot. Its oversized
    rounded ears perk up, and it looks entirely content. The glistening wet leaves
    of the potted seedling sway slightly in a gentle breeze under the bright outback
    sun.
