DYNAMIC REFERENCE IMAGES:
The video generation model you are writing for has a strict limit of THREE (3) reference images per text-to-video (T2V) shot.
Your channel currently has {{ channel.characters | length }} predefined character(s).
You should create a flexible pool of new dynamic reference images (such as specific props, guest characters, or background scenery) to draw from.
For any given T2V shot, you can combine the character(s) with any objects from the dynamic pool, as long as each individual shot's `reference_images` array does not exceed 3 total items. Use different objects in different scenes to keep the story fresh, while relying on the pool to maintain consistency across scenes when an object returns!
